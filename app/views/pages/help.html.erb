      <h3>How can I update my domain record dynamically?</h3>
      <div>
        We offer two API's: Complete REST API and Simple API.<br />
        Using the simple API you can update your records using the following shell commands:<br />
        <br />
        
        With IP specified:
        <pre style="margin-top: 0;">curl -X PUT -d "ip=IP" http://entrydns.net/records/modify/TOKEN</pre>

        With IP automatically computed from request origin:
        <pre style="margin-top: 0;">curl -X PUT -d "" http://entrydns.net/records/modify/TOKEN</pre>
      </div>
